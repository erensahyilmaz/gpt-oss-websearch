## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install required dependencies
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers triton==3.4 kernels
pip install gpt-oss openai_harmony
pip install pdfplumber pandas nest_asyncio
```

### Environment Setup

Set your You.com API key:
```python
os.environ["YDC_API_KEY"] = "your-ydc-api-key-here"
```

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Model Initialization

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_id = "openai/gpt-oss-20b"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_id,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="cuda",
)
```

### 2. Web Search Function

The main `web_search()` function performs intelligent web searches:

```python
result = await web_search("What's the weather in Istanbul right now?", model)
print(result)
```

**Function Features:**
- Performs You.com web search
- Opens and analyzes reliable sources
- Provides summarized, up-to-date information
- Handles tool calls and browser interactions automatically

### 3. Intelligent Chat with Custom System Prompts

The `answer()` function provides flexible response generation with customizable system prompts:

```python
def answer(question):
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant. Choose a movie for movie night. Do NOT select any movie listed in the watched movies. Exclude them strictly. Reasoning: High."},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"{question}"},
    ]
    # Process and return clean response
```

**Key Features:**
- Customizable system content for different tasks
- Regex-based response parsing for clean output
- High reasoning effort for detailed analysis
- Token-efficient processing

### 4. Document Analysis

Process PDF documents for analysis:

```python
import pdfplumber

with pdfplumber.open("document.pdf") as pdf:
    text = ""
    for page in pdf.pages:
        text += page.extract_text() + "\n"

evaluation = answer(f"Evaluate this CV: {text}")
```

## üìã Core Functions

### `web_search(question, model)`
- **Purpose**: Performs intelligent web searches with source verification
- **Parameters**: 
  - `question`: The query to search for
  - `model`: The GPT-OSS model instance
- **Returns**: Processed and summarized web search results
- **Features**: Two-stage inference process for optimal accuracy

### `answer(question)`
- **Purpose**: Generates intelligent responses with customizable system prompts
- **Parameters**: `question` - The input query
- **Returns**: Processed response based on system configuration
- **Special**: Uses high reasoning effort and regex parsing for clean output
- **Customizable**: System content can be modified for different use cases

## üéØ Example Use Cases

The code demonstrates several practical applications:

1. **Real-time Information**: Weather updates, sports scores, current events
2. **Gaming Data**: EA FC player ratings, transfer news
3. **Entertainment News**: Celebrity updates, show information
4. **Document Review**: CV evaluation, document analysis
5. **Movie Recommendations**: Intelligent film selection based on viewing history
6. **Batch Processing**: Multiple question processing from Excel/CSV files


### Intelligent Movie Selection
```python
prompt = f"""
You are a helpful assistant tasked with choosing a movie for a movie night.
Do NOT select any movie that is already in the watched movies list below.
Available movies to choose from:
- Il Treno dei Bambini (2024)
- Cast Away (Tom Hanks)
- Inception (Christopher Nolan)
- I Want You Back (2022)
- Drive (Ryan Gosling)
- Whiplash (JK Simmons)
- Instant Family (Mark Wahlberg)
- Memento

Movies already watched: {watched_movies}
Choose the best movie considering the taste of two people described below.
Only return the movie title, nothing else.
Person 1: {df}
Person 2: {df1}
"""

recommendation = answer(prompt)
```

**Features:**
- Multi-person taste analysis
- Watched movie exclusion
- Genre-based recommendations
- Batch movie selection (top 5 recommendations)

The project includes Excel file processing capabilities:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_excel("search_questions.xlsx")
questions = df['question'].tolist()

# Process multiple questions
responses = []
for question in questions:
    response = answer(question)
    responses.append(response)
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Two-Stage Inference Process

1. **Stage 1**: Web search and tool usage enabled
   - Performs You.com search
   - Opens reliable sources
   - Extracts relevant information

2. **Stage 2**: Final answer generation without tools
   - Processes collected information
   - Generates comprehensive response
   - Ensures no additional tool calls

### Async Implementation

Uses `nest_asyncio` for proper async handling in notebook environments:

```python
import nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio.apply()

result = asyncio.run(web_search("Your question here", model))
```

## üîß Configuration Options

- **Reasoning Effort**: Set to `ReasoningEffort.HIGH` for detailed analysis
- **Max Tokens**: Configurable output length (1000-3000 tokens)
- **Device Mapping**: CUDA support for GPU acceleration
- **Tool Integration**: Browser tool with You.com backend

## üö® Important Notes

- Requires CUDA-compatible GPU for optimal performance
- You.com API key needed for web search functionality
- Model downloads ~40GB (GPT-OSS 20B parameters)
- Async functions must be run with `asyncio.run()` or in async context

## üìà Performance Tips

1. Use GPU acceleration for faster inference
2. Batch process multiple questions for efficiency
3. Cache frequently accessed model components
4. Monitor API rate limits for You.com searches
